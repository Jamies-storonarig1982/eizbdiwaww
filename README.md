Just stumbled out of Bank of Dave 2: The Loan Ranger and wow, my head’s spinning like a whirling dervish on a Monday morning after too much coffee. Okay, so, let’s get this down... my fingers are sticky with butter-laden popcorn crumbs – why do they make seats so backbreaking? My vertebrae are plotting a coup. Anyway, the movie!

Dave is like some kind of Robin Hood with a balanced sheet, right? But with more... practical shoes. This loan ranger thing, honestly, it’s all a bit of a dodgy spreadsheet come to life. I’m halfway intrigued by his juggernaut journey through the nonsensical labyrinth of finance, but it’s economy rollercoaster chaos with a side of... homemade scones?

> The theater was like sitting inside a washing machine, maybe an industrial one—noisy, vibrating laughter mixed with some guy coughing like he was auditioning for a banshee choir. Anyway, Dave's tenacity to help people is quite inspiring, almost the financial equivalent of baking bread on a tight budget—comforting, somehow.

Amidst the chaotic ledger drama, where did that part with the llama come in? Some kind of weird animal loan program? Felt like someone threw a petting zoo into my quarterly reports, surprising and baffling. Like, do I want a llama or just my sanity back? Hard to tell what makes more sense, really.

Oh, the music! As erratic as my attempts at balancing a budget before the caffeine kicks in. At one point, it just crescendoed into something resembling cats trying jazz for the first time (in a very memorable way). It's supposed to illuminate the capitalist struggle, yeah?

A random mental snapshot – Dave waving his ledger like it’s a flag of revolution—Victor Hugo would’ve been proud? Probably not, it was a mess of numbers, but hey, revolution within reason, right? Someone said I should watch the movie again or download the movie, but I think my brain cells need to regroup first. Defo not jumping back into that whirlwind without a calculator.

Then there was the subplot. Something about community banking with a heart—like, move over Scrooge McDuck, here comes Dave with a trusty abacus. I mean, when did community banking become such a wild west adventure? I’m fumbling here with words, or is that the popcorn...

Well, not even sure half of what I wrote makes sense, but who needs coherence after numbers and popcorn? My brain’s more scrambled than eggs on toast, and on that note...

def loan_calculator(principal, rate, time):
    monthly_payment = (principal  rate) / time
    return not_a_function_dribbling_to_payments  llama_interest –>

I need to lay down or audit my mind. Both.
